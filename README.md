# Yeoman jjoadevy generator

### What is this?
↪ It's a shortcut to install initial configs to setup dev tooling for a React project workflow (ESLint & other things) or ESLINT configs for a NextJS project. It's a fork and a small adaptation of the [goncy generator](https://github.com/goncy/generator)🙏🏼 customized for my personal requirements.

### How can I use it?

1. Install Yeoman globally: `npm install -g yo`    

    
2. Then install the jjoadevy generator globally: `npm install -g generator-jjoadevy`   

   
3. Navigate to a directory you want to generate the files in, then run the command with the flag you want:   
* `yo jjoadevy:react` to initialize the react-eslint-tailwind CLI and select the options you want to install.  
* `yo jjoadevy:next` to directly start downloading eslint config for NextJS.
