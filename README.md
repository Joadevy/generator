# Yeoman jjoadevy generator

### What is this?

=> It's a command for install initial configs to setup a React project workflow (ESLint & other things). It's a fork and a small adaptation of the [goncy generator](https://github.com/goncy/generator)🙏🏼 customized for my personal requirements.

### How can I use it? (Not ready yet, available soon!)

Install Yeoman globally: `npm install -g yo`

Then install the jjoadevy generator globally: ` npm install -g generator-jjoadevy`

Navigate to a directory you want to generate the files in, then run` yo jjoadevy:react`

Then select the options you want to install & enjoy saving your time copy-pasting boring settings.
